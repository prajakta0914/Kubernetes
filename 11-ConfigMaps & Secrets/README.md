ConfigMaps are Kubernetes objects that allow you to separate configuration data/files from image content to keep containerized applications portable.

ConfigMaps bind configuration files, command-line arguments, surroundings variables, port numbers, and alternative configuration artifacts to your Pods containers and system parts at run-time.

ConfigMaps are helpful for storing and sharing non-sensitive, unencrypted configuration data.
